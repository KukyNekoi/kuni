# Welcome to mimashita.moe

I'm KuKy_NeKoi, owner of this small realm. There are some shit stored on this server which no one uses and no one cares about.

You can check more info about me if you click on [purr](./purr.html). There are some [links](./links.html) on where you can find some resources that I often visit on the web.

I do some programming on my free time, which you can check it on the [code](./code.html) page.

```bash
goto purr --goto
```
